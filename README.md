# Project 1: Basic Image Manipulation with OpenCV
This project is my first step in my Computer Vision journey. It's a simple python script like "print("Hello World!") but for computer vision, this demonstrates fundamental image processing operations using OpenCV library.

# Technologies Used
- Ubuntu 
- Conda for environment management
- Python 
- OpenCV
- Numpy

# What it does
- Loads ang image from a local file.
- Converts the loaded image into grayscale.
- Displays both the original and the grayscale images and also its dimensions.

# Steps to follow
1) Clone or download repository
2) Ensure you have a python environment with required libraries installed (OpenCV, Numpy).
3) Place an image file in main directory and rename it to 'test_image.jpg" or modify 'image_path' variable in 'load_img.py' script.
4) Run the script from terminal:
          python load_img.py
